Node.js + Comet example using Faye.

Mostly derived from the Faye examples: http://github.com/jcoglan/faye
And from this lovely post: http://bit.ly/bqkQ9O.

Usage: node server.js [port]

Starts an http server on port [port], defaults to 8000.
Then by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:[port], magic will happen.
Client currently configured to wait for messages from the server. Server
Sends messages via stdin.
